First check your current branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```
You are currently on the `dev` branch. Let me explain the standard Git branch management workflow and best practices:

1. **Branch Structure**:
   - `main` (or `master`): Production-ready code
   - `dev`: Development branch (what you're on now)
   - `feature/*`: Feature branches
   - `bugfix/*`: Bug fix branches
   - `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production
   - `release/*`: Release preparation branches

Let's see all your current branches:

```bash
git branch -a
```
Here's the recommended workflow for development:

1. **Working on New Features**:
```bash
# Create a new feature branch from dev
git checkout -b feature/new-feature dev

# Work on your changes...
# Then commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Keep your feature branch up to date with dev
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature/new-feature
git rebase dev

# When feature is complete, push to remote
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub from feature/new-feature -> dev
```

2. **Bug Fixes**:
```bash
# Create a bug fix branch
git checkout -b bugfix/bug-description dev

# Fix the bug, commit, and push
git add .
git commit -m "Fixed bug: description"
git push origin bugfix/bug-description

# Create a Pull Request to dev
```

3. **Best Practices**:
- Always pull latest changes before starting new work:
```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

- Keep commits atomic and well-described:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix: resolve login page redirect issue"
```

Let's demonstrate some useful commands for branch management:

1. Check branch status:

```bash
git status
```
2. View commit history:

```bash
git log --oneline -n 5
```
**Key Points for Development in `dev` Branch**:

1. **Starting New Work**:
   - Always start from an updated dev branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   ```

2. **Feature Development**:
   - Create feature branches from dev
   - Keep commits small and focused
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Regularly rebase with dev to stay up-to-date

3. **Code Review Process**:
   - Push your feature branch to remote
   - Create Pull Request to dev
   - Get code review
   - Address feedback
   - Merge only when approved

4. **Keeping Branches Clean**:
   - Delete feature branches after merging
   - Regularly update your local dev branch
   - Use `git rebase` to maintain clean history

5. **Deployment Flow**:
   ```
   Feature Branch -> dev (development/testing) -> main (production)
   ```

**Useful Git Commands for Daily Work**:
```bash
# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/name

# Stash changes temporarily
git stash
git stash pop

# Update branch with latest changes
git pull --rebase origin dev

# Undo last commit (keeping changes)
git reset --soft HEAD^

# View branch history
git log --graph --oneline --all

# Clean up local branches
git branch --merged | grep -v "\*" | xargs -n 1 git branch -d
```

To completely discard your local changes and reset your branch to match the remote’s latest commit, you can use the following commands:

1. **Fetch the Latest Remote Changes:**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Reset Your Local Branch:**

   Replace `<branch>` with your branch name (e.g., `master` or `main`):

   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/<branch>
   ```

3. **Remove Untracked Files (Optional):**

   If you also want to remove any untracked files or directories, run:

   ```bash
   git clean -fd
   ```

These steps will force your local repository to match the current state of the remote branch, discarding all local modifications and untracked files. Use these commands with caution as they permanently delete local changes that haven’t been committed or pushed.

---

## Renaming branches 

### 1. Prepare by Checking Your Current Branches

Before making any changes, verify which branches exist locally and what their upstream remotes are. This helps avoid confusion later.

```bash
git branch -vv
```

*Explanation:*  
This command lists all local branches with details about their last commit and the remote branch they track. It’s a good check to know where you are starting.

---

### 2. Rename the Old “main” Branch to “original”

If the old “main” branch (your original stable branch) still exists and you want to preserve it under a new name (“original”), follow these steps:

#### a. Switch to the old main branch

```bash
git checkout main
```

*Explanation:*  
This command checks out the old main branch so you can rename it.

#### b. Rename it locally

```bash
git branch -m main original
```

*Explanation:*  
The `-m` flag renames the branch from “main” to “original” locally. (The `-m` stands for “move/rename.”)

#### c. Push the new “original” branch to remote

```bash
git push origin original
```

*Explanation:*  
This pushes the renamed branch to the remote repository. If the branch “original” doesn’t exist remotely yet, it will be created.

#### d. Remove the old “main” branch from the remote

```bash
git push origin --delete main
```

*Explanation:*  
This command deletes the remote branch named “main.” (Be sure that no one else is using it or that you’ve coordinated this change with your team.)  
*Note:* Some repository hosts (like GitHub) require you to change the default branch in the settings before you can delete “main.”

---

### 3. Rename the “dev” Branch to “main”

Now that the old “main” branch has been renamed and removed from remote, you can safely rename your stable “dev” branch to “main.”

#### a. Switch to your dev branch

```bash
git checkout dev
```

*Explanation:*  
Make sure you are on the dev branch that you want to promote.

#### b. Rename it locally to main

```bash
git branch -m dev main
```

*Explanation:*  
This renames your current dev branch to “main” locally.

#### c. Push the new “main” branch to remote

```bash
git push origin main
```

*Explanation:*  
This pushes the newly renamed main branch to your remote repository.

#### d. Set the upstream for the new main branch

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

*Explanation:*  
This command establishes a tracking connection between your local “main” branch and the remote “main” branch so that future `git pull` or `git push` commands work without needing to specify the branch.

---

### 4. Additional Useful Commands

- **View the commit history as a graph:**

  ```bash
  git log --graph --oneline --decorate
  ```

  *Explanation:*  
  This command provides a concise, graphical view of your commit history, which is useful to verify that your branches have the correct history after renaming.

- **List all branches (local and remote):**

  ```bash
  git branch -a
  ```

  *Explanation:*  
  This shows you all branches, including remote-tracking branches, to ensure that your changes have been propagated as expected.

---

### 5. Final Considerations

- **Remote Default Branch:**  
  If your repository is hosted on platforms like GitHub or GitLab, remember to update the default branch setting in the repository settings to “main.” This ensures that pull requests and CI/CD pipelines are aligned with the new naming.

- **Inform Your Team:**  
  Renaming branches can affect collaborators. Make sure everyone updates their local clones accordingly, for example by running:

  ```bash
  git fetch --all --prune
  ```

  *Explanation:*  
  This command fetches all updates from the remote and cleans up any deleted remote branches.

- **Backup:**  
  Before performing branch deletions, ensure that your work is backed up (or that you have a reference, such as a tag) in case you need to revert the changes.

---

### Summary

1. **Rename the old main branch:**
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git branch -m main original`
   - `git push origin original`
   - `git push origin --delete main`
2. **Rename dev to main:**
   - `git checkout dev`
   - `git branch -m dev main`
   - `git push origin main`
   - `git push --set-upstream origin main`
3. **Verify changes and update settings if necessary.**

An efficient strategy is: create a PR from dev to main—with code review done, no conflicts, and the goal of making dev’s stable state the new main—the simplest approach is to merge the PR using a **merge commit**. This approach preserves full commit history and clearly shows that dev was merged into main.

### Why Use "Create a Merge Commit"?

- **Preserves Full History:** A merge commit keeps every commit from dev intact. This is useful for auditing and understanding the evolution of your features.
- **Non-destructive:** It doesn’t rewrite any commit hashes or lose the granularity of your commits. This is safer when you want to maintain a detailed history.
- **Clear Branch Record:** It clearly documents that a merge happened—ideal for future reference.

*In contrast:*
- **Squash and Merge** would combine all changes into one commit, which gives you a cleaner history on main but loses individual commit details.
- **Rebase and Merge** creates a linear history but rewrites commit hashes, which can be problematic if others already share the dev branch.

### Summary

- **Merge the PR using "Create a Merge Commit"** to incorporate all changes from dev while preserving the commit history.
- **Rename the old main branch to "original"** to keep it as a reference.
- **Update your default branch settings** and have your team clean up their local repositories.

## restore local branch to the remote's head

1. **Fetch the Latest Remote Updates:**

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

   *Explanation:*  
   This updates your remote-tracking branches (like `origin/main`) with the latest state from the server.

2. **Reset Your Local main Branch to the Remote State:**

   ```bash
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

   *Explanation:*  
   This command resets your current branch’s pointer and working directory to match `origin/main` exactly. It discards any local commits and modifications.

3. **(Optional) Remove Untracked Files and Directories:**

   If you have untracked files that you also want to remove, run:

   ```bash
   git clean -fd
   ```

   *Explanation:*  
   This deletes all untracked files and directories, ensuring your working tree mirrors the remote repository.
